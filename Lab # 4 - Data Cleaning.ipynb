    "    In this lab, we are taking three raw data sets and cleaning them to the best of our ability, and indicating what more we would like to do to better clean the data if we had the time and/or the coding skill. We are not cleaning the data to serve a specific purpose, or to do any statistical analysis; instead, we are just practicing our data cleaning skills and learning code to best do so. There are three data sets: the first, is the Boing Boing data set, which is one on candy. The second, is a dataset that is about the average percent of attendance at public schools, categorized by state. The last dataset is data on ticket sales for national U.S. events. "

    "    This lab made me realize how much work data cleaning is, and how to is very dependant upon what analysis one wants to pull from the data, so that the cleaning is focused on the needs of the analysist/person using the data. For the first data set, I was not able to apply every data cleaning part to all the data. One thing I would have liked to do, but did not have the coding knowledge to do, is to find out how many NaN values are in a column, and if there are more than 20% Nan values, that column is deleted. This way insufficient data is removed.\n",
    "    For the second dataset, I wish I could know how to delete all blank rows in one line of code. I would have also wished I could remove the parentheses in some of the data values, so it can all be uniform. \n",
    "    Finally, for the last dataset, I wish I had more metadata so that by better understanding what each column is for, I would know what to omit, and what to change.\n",
